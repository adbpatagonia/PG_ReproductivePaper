This document is intended for internal use of the Fisheries and Oceans Canada team.       
Project led by Garry Stenson and Shelley Lang. 

Code and environemntal data to reproduce the analyses summarized in this document can be found in [**this repository**](https://github.com/adbpatagonia/PG_ReproductivePaper).     
Seal and prey field data will not be made available in the repository

### Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation         

For the capelin paper (@Buren_etal_2014) we used the 121-month smoothed estimates      

The AMO was based on the Kaplan SST, but the dataset is not being updated anymore.  
https://psl.noaa.gov/data/timeseries/AMO/   

Therefore, I downloaded a few different options: 

1. Kaplan, unsmoothed: data/environment/AMO/amon.us.data.txt    
https://psl.noaa.gov/data/correlation/amon.us.data    https://psl.noaa.gov/data/correlation/amon.us.long.data    
Data up to 2022          

2. Kaplan, smoothed: data/environment/AMO/amon.sm.data      
https://psl.noaa.gov/data/correlation/amon.sm.data     https://psl.noaa.gov/data/correlation/amon.sm.long.data
Data up to Jan 2018       

3. NOAA/NCEI has a time-series of the AMO based on the NOAA ERSSTV5: data/environment/AMO/ersst.v5.amo.dat.txt    
https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cmb/ersst/v5/index/ersst.v5.amo.dat   
Data up to July 2024     


#### Kaplan dataset     

Last smoothed estimate is from January 2018      

<ins>Method:</ins>                 

  * Use the Kaplan SST dataset     
  * Compute the area weighted average over the N Atlantic, basically 0 to 70N.  
  * Detrend that time series        
  * Smooth it with a 121 month smoother.          
  
```{r amokaplan, echo = FALSE}
p.amo.kaplan
``` 


#### NOAA/NCEI dataset     

Last smoothed estimate is from July 2019       

I applied the same smoother as applied to the Kaplan dataset.     

It looks like these data have not been detrended. AMO code is provided in the PSL website, (code provided by NCAR: National Center for Atmospheric Research) [**here**](https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/Scripts/index_amo_1.ncl). 


```{r amonoaa, echo = FALSE}
p.amo.noaa
``` 

#### Conclusion        

The two datasets look similar, but the NOAA/NCEI has not been detrended.   
NCAR provides AMO code. I am not sure what language this is, but I am sure that if we needed to use this dataset we could figure it out.        
Note the very similar length  of the datasets:    

  * Kaplan: up to January 2018     
  * NOAA/NCEI: up to July 2019      
  
Note that these data are still at a monthly scale. We still need to define how we will translate it to an annual value.         
Thoughts on how to proceed?

#### Annualize AMO        

follow the same strategy as for NAO and AO, *i.e.* get the JFM mean    

In this plot,   

  * thin line: extracted and averaged the JFM values of the unsmoothed Kaplan dataset       
  * thick black line: extracted and averaged the JFM values of the smoothed Kaplan dataset    
  * thick red line: extracted and averaged the JFM values of the unsmoothed Kaplan dataset, and obtained the 10-year (equivalent to 121-month) rolling average       
    
```{r annualamonoaa, echo = FALSE}
p.amo.kaplan.annual
```   
    

### Arctic Oscillation

https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/daily_ao_index/ao.shtml                   


Data is at a monthly scale. We need to smooth it. How should we do it? I can think of at least two options:           

  *  use a running average, as for AMO             
  *  use seasonal mean, as for NAO. See @Zhang_etal_2021          
  
I am not sure how to approach this. I couldn't find any details in @Mullowney_etal_2023  on how they approached it. Maybe Shelley can check in with Darrell or Fred?       
```{r aoplot, echo = FALSE}
p.ao
```

#### Smoothed                

Last smoothed estimate is from August 2019       

I applied the same smoother as applied to the AMO Kaplan dataset, not detrended. 

```{r aosmplot, echo = FALSE}
p.ao.sm
```

#### Seasonal        

This reproduces  @Zhang_etal_2021, *i.e.* mean AO from January to March

```{r aoseasonalplot, echo = FALSE}
p.ao.seasonal
```

This is the plot presented by @Zhang_etal_2021      
![](AOI_Zhang.jpg "Zhang et al. 2021")

This plot presents it in a similar fashion as @Mullowney_etal_2023. It is quite close, but not identical   

```{r aoseasonalbarplot, echo = FALSE}
p.ao.seasonal.bars
```

This is the plot presented by @Mullowney_etal_2023      
![](AOI_Mullowney.PNG "Mullowney et al. 2023")

#### Conclusion        

I can perfectly reproduce @Zhang_etal_2021.     
I can almost reproduce @Mullowney_etal_2023.   
The smoothed estimate does not look like what is presented in @Mullowney_etal_2023.     

I think the important question here is: what is the expected effect of AO on the environment?   
Can Shelley approach Fred?   

### Ice Area Cover                

Downloaded from Canadian Ice Service    

https://iceweb1.cis.ec.gc.ca/IceGraph/page1.xhtml?lang=en        

In @Stenson_etal_2016: *As a proxy for habitat change, we used the annual percentage midwinter ice area cover (week of 29 January). The percentage of ice cover was defined as the proportion of the regional East Coast (area: 1 975 854 km<sup>2</sup>) that was covered by first-year ice (â‰¥30 cm thickness)*  


```{r iceplot, echo = FALSE}
p.ice
```

### Correlations among environmental variables     

In this plot, the AMO is the annualized taking the JFM mean of the smoothed values, *i.e.* the black thick line in [Annualize AMO](#annualize-amo)   


<ins>High correlation (> 0.5):</ins>    

  * winter NAO and AO (0.78)   
  * NLCI and Ice Area (-0.76)   

<ins>Moderate correlation (between 0.3 and 0.5):</ins>    

  * winter NAO and NLCI (-0.49)   
  * winter AMO and NLCI (0.41)   
  * winter AMO and Ice Area (-0.4)  
  * winter NAO and Ice Area (0.37)    
  * NLCI and AO (-0.34)     
  
<ins>Low correlation (< 0.3):</ins>         

  * Ice Area and AO (0.123)      
  * winter AMO and AO (0.1)       
  * winter AMO and winter NAO (-0.01)

<!-- All variables are correlated to a higher or lesser degree, except Ice Area Cover and AOI (mean of JFM AO) -->
    
```{r envcorrsplot, echo = FALSE}
p.env.corrs
```

Maybe we are OK like this? *i.e.* dropping NLCI and NAO   
I would really like to understand the hypothesized effect of each index on the environment to make this decision, but maybe I am asking too much?                

```{r envcorrsplotreduced, echo = FALSE}
 ggpairs(env.dat %>% select(-year, -NLCI, -winterNAO))
```

This would also be in line with how one would approach this by looking at multicollinearity through variance inflation factors (@Zuur_etal_2010). Drop the variable with the highest VIF until all variables have VIFs < 3.  
  
<br />               

All variables    

```{r VIFS,  echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

kable(vifs, digits = 2) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"),
                full_width = FALSE) 
``` 

Dropping NLCI 

```{r VIFS_no_NLCI,  echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

kable(vifs_nonlci, digits = 2) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"),
                full_width = FALSE) 
``` 

Dropping winter NAO - all VIFs < 3

```{r VIFS_reduced,  echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

kable(vifs.reduced, digits = 2) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"),
                full_width = FALSE) 
```
